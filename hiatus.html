                        <p>I have been putting off writing this first blog post for the better part of two years. A lack of focus is probably the main reason why. Its 2021, we all have ADHD and I am no exception to the rule. How strange that a diagnosis could be so pervasive to modern society. Blame the lizard shape shifting Zuckerberg I say.</p>
                        <p>Either way, let’s stay on task. What is this blog for? I named it as the Ignorant View, for the reason that I am ignorant in everything I do. ‘If there is one thing I know, is that I know nothing at all’. – Socrates. Yes…yes, I will shamelessly insert a cliché quote where possible. Get used to it.</p>
                        <p>And I do hope you do get used it. I plan to pump these ‘things’ twice every week. A pact to myself. These ‘things’ will mostly cover my experiences and journey to financial freedom. A sort of documentation. I have absolute no idea where I want to take this, but I hope we can find out over time.</p>
                        <p>Right, so a bit about myself. Lets get this out in one go because I really avoid talking about by myself (says the person starting a blog). Take a deep breath, and….</p>
                        <p>I am a 22 year old, Black British History graduate who is currently in their second year of teaching Design and Technology in a secondary school (it makes sense, read it again), who is quite introverted but likes a bit of socialising until my social battery depletes, so like most people, I am a walking contradiction who seeks to be outraged, and other than that I am really just a normal, average person who is still wondering why they didn’t buy bitcoin in 2013 (we all had the chance, even my pubescent self).</p>
                        <p>Now that the vanity is out the way, as mentioned, this thing will generally focus on my attempt to achieve financial freedom. We have heard the term before and I am sure I am not the only one who has tried to sell you a Forex trading course or help set up your own shopify/dropshipping business from home. No, this is a narcissistic narration of my journey from one shiny object to another, stopping by financial Tik Tok teenfluencers along the way. To premise the pilot episode of this thing, I will catch you up on the last two years I was on hiatus (lets hope this isn’t an anime and doesn’t happen again).</p>
